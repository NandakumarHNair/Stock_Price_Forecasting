# Stock Price Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a predictive model to forecast stock prices using linear regression and decision trees. The model aims to improve prediction accuracy by 15%.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include normalization and feature engineering to enhance model performance.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The best model's predictions are saved in `predictions.csv`.
